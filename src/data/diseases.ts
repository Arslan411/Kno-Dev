  What is Gonorrhea?
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by infection with the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium. N. gonorrhoeae infects the mucous membranes of the reproductive tract.
    <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
    How common is Gonorrhea?
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Gonorrhea is a very common infectious disease. CDC estimates that approximately 1.6 million new gonococcal infections occurred in the United States in 2018, and more than half occur among young people aged 15-24. Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States.  However, many infections are asymptomatic, so reported cases only capture a fraction of the true burden.
  <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">

  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Gonorrhea can be cured with the right treatment. If a person’s symptoms continue for more than a few days after receiving treatment, he or she should return to a healthcare provider to be reevaluated.
  Because re-infection is common, men and women with gonorrhea should be retested three months after treatment of the initial infection, regardless of whether they believe that their sex partners were successfully treated.
    
  </p>
  <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
  How is Gonorrhea spread?

  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Gonorrhea is transmitted through sexual contact with the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus of an infected partner. Ejaculation does not have to occur for gonorrhea to be transmitted or acquired. Gonorrhea can also be spread perinatally from mother to baby during childbirth.
  People who have had gonorrhea and received treatment may be reinfected if they have sexual contact with a person infected with gonorrhea.
      
     <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
     What are the signs and symptoms of Gonorrhea?


  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">

  Many men with gonorrhea are asymptomatic. When present, signs and symptoms of urethral infection in men include dysuria or a white, yellow, or green urethral discharge that usually appears one to fourteen days after infection. In cases where urethral infection is complicated by epididymitis, men with gonorrhea may also complain of testicular or scrotal pain.
  Most women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic. Even when a woman has symptoms, they are often so mild and nonspecific that they are mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. The initial symptoms and signs in women include dysuria, increased vaginal discharge, or vaginal bleeding between periods. Women with gonorrhea are at risk of developing serious complications from the infection, regardless of the presence or severity of symptoms.
  Symptoms of rectal infection in both men and women may include discharge, anal itching, soreness, bleeding, or painful bowel movements. Rectal infection also may be asymptomatic. Pharyngeal infection may cause a sore throat, but usually is asymptomatic.

  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Chlamydia is a common STD that can cause infection among both men and women. It can cause permanent damage to a woman’s reproductive system. This can make it difficult or impossible to get pregnant later.

  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Chlamydia is the most common STI caused by bacteria. About 1.5 million cases of chlamydia are reported each year. The number of infections is likely even higher. Most cases of chlamydia are asymptomatic, which means there are no signs or symptoms of an infection.

  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Yes, the right treatment can cure chlamydia. It is important that you take all of the medicine your healthcare provider gives you to cure your infection. Do not share medicine for chlamydia with anyone. When taken properly, it will stop the infection and could decrease your chances of having problems later. Although medicine will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease.
  Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. You should receive testing again about three months after your treatment, even if your sex partner(s) receives treatment.

  You can get chlamydia by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has chlamydia. Also, you can still get chlamydia even if your sex partner does not ejaculate (cum). A pregnant person with chlamydia can give the infection to their baby during childbirth.
    
     <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
     What are the signs and symptoms of chlamydia?

  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Chlamydia is sometimes called a silent infection because the majority of people (between 50% and 70%) who have chlamydia — regardless of assigned sex — never notice symptoms.

  People who do notice symptoms often don’t recognize the signs that they have chlamydia until a few weeks after they’ve been infected. Because chlamydia cases are often asymptomatic, it’s easy to spread chlamydia to someone else without realizing it. And it’s easy to miss out on receiving the treatment needed to prevent the serious complications that can result from chlamydia.

  What is Trich?
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Trichomoniasis (or “trich”) is a very common STD caused by infection with Trichomonas vaginalis (a protozoan parasite). Although symptoms vary, most people who have trich cannot tell they have it.
  </p>
  <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
  How common is Trich
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  In the United States, CDC estimates that there were more than two million trichomoniasis infections in 2018. However, only about 30% develop any symptoms of trich. Infection is more common in women than in men. Older women are more likely than younger women to have the infection.
  </p>
  <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
  More about treatment for Trich?
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Trich is the most common curable STD. A healthcare provider can treat the infection with medication (pills) taken by mouth. This treatment is also safe for pregnant people.
  If you receive and complete treatment for trich, you can still get it again. Reinfection occurs in about 1 in 5 people within 3 months after receiving treatment. This can happen if you have sex without a condom with a person who has trich. To avoid reinfection, your sex partners should receive treatment at the same time.
  You should not have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) complete treatment. You should receive testing again about three months after your treatment, even if your sex partner(s) received treatment.
      <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
      How is trichomoniasis spread?
      </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Sexually active people can get trich by having sex without a condom with a partner who has trich.
  In women, the infection is most commonly found in the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, cervix, or urethra). In men, the infection is most commonly found inside the penis (urethra). During sex, the parasite usually spreads from a penis to a vagina, or from a vagina to a penis. It can also spread from a vagina to another vagina.
  It is not common for the parasite to infect other body parts, like the hands, mouth, or anus. It is unclear why some people with the infection get symptoms while others do not. It probably depends on factors like a person’s age and overall health. People with trich can pass the infection to others, even if they do not have symptoms.
    <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
    What are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?
    </h2>
<p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
Most people have flu-like symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks after infection.Symptoms may last for a few days or several weeks and are often disregarded as a common illness. Other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all.
<h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
Take Time to Process the News
    </h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  About 70% of people with the infection do not have any signs or symptoms. When trich does cause symptoms, they can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Some people get symptoms within 5 to 28 days after getting the infection. Others do not develop symptoms until much later. Symptoms can come and go.
Having trich can make sex feel unpleasant. Without treatment, the infection can last for months or even years.

    Most people with herpes have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. Mild symptoms may go unnoticed or be mistaken for other skin conditions like a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people do not know they have a herpes infection.
    Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. This is known as having an “outbreak.” The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, body aches, or swollen glands) also may occur during the first outbreak.
    People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks. However, repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although HSV-1 is a lifelong infection, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.

     What are the signs and symptoms of HSV-2?
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Most people with HSV-2 have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. Mild symptoms may go unnoticed or be mistaken for other skin conditions like a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people do not know they have a herpes infection.
  Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. This is known as having an “outbreak”. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, body aches, or swollen glands) also may occur during the first outbreak.
  People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks. However, repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although genital herpes is a lifelong infection, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.

     <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
     See your doctor again if you notice any symptoms
     </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  STD symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods (if you have a menstrual cycle).
  Have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider about herpes and any concerns you may have.

  What is Mpox?

  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Mpox (monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick. Anyone can get mpox
  <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
  How is Mpox spread?
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Close or Intimate Contact
  Mpox can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact, including: 
  Direct contact with mpox rash and scabs from a person with mpox, as well as contact with their saliva, upper respiratory secretions (snot, mucus), and areas around the anus, rectum, or vagina
  This direct contact can happen during intimate contact, including:
  Oral, anal, or vaginal sex, or touching the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus of a person with mpox
  Hugging, massage, and kissing. Prolonged face-to-face contact
  The risk is considered low for getting mpox by touching objects, fabrics, and surfaces that have been used by someone with mpox and not disinfected, such as clothing, bedding, towels, fetish gear, or sex toys.
  A person with mpox can spread it to others from the time symptoms start until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed. As of February 2023, new data show that some people can spread mpox to others from one to four days before their symptoms appear. 
    
  <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
  What are the signs and symptoms of Mpox?


  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  People with mpox often get a rash that may be located on hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth or near the genitals, including penis, testicles, labia, and vagina, and anus.  The incubation period is 3-17 days. During this time, a person does not have symptoms and may feel fine.
  The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing. The rash can initially look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy. Other symptoms of mpox can include:
  Fever
  Chills
  Swollen lymph nodes
  Exhaustion
  Muscle aches and backache
  Headache
  Respiratory symptoms (e.g., sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough)
  You may experience all or only a few symptoms Sometimes, people have flu-like symptoms before the rash. Some people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms. Others only experience a rash.

  People with HIV should take medicine to treat HIV as soon as possible. HIV medicine is called antiretroviral therapy, or ART. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine reduces the amount of HIV in the body (viral load) to a very low level, which keeps the immune system working and prevents illness. This is called viral suppression—defined as having less than 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood. HIV medicine can even make the viral load so low that a test can’t detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load.
  Getting and keeping an undetectable viral load* is the best thing people with HIV can do to stay healthy. Another benefit of reducing the amount of virus in the body is that it prevents transmission to others through sex.

  What is Hepatitis B?

  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Hepatitis B is a liver disease. It is caused by the Hepatitis B virus. For some people who get Hepatitis B, the virus stays in the body, causing a lifelong illness. Hepatitis B can cause serious health problems over time. These problems can include liver failure and liver cancer.
    <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
    How common is Hepatitis B?
  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Hepatitis B is the most common liver infection in the world. As many as 2 billion people (or 1 in 3) have been infected worldwide. Approximately 250 million people worldwide are living with chronic hepatitis B infection, many unaware.
  It’s less common in the U.S. than in some other places, thanks to the vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates approximately 20,000 new acute infections occur in the U.S. each year. An estimated 862,000 people in the U.S. are living with chronic hepatitis B.
  
  <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 20px;">
  How is Hepatitis B spread?

  </h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify; width: 95%;">
  Hepatitis B infection comes from the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus spreads through bodily fluids. Transmission occurs when fluids from the body of a person who’s infected enter the body of a person who’s uninfected. This might happen through:
  <br> Contact with an open wound
  </br>
  <br> Sharing needles or syringes </br>
  <br> Sharing a toothbrush or razor
  . </br>
  <br> Childbirth </br>
  <br> Accidental stick from an infected sharp instrument
  </br>
  <br></br>
  HBV can live on surfaces outside of your body for at least seven days. So, used instruments that haven’t been sterilized can still carry the virus. This includes medical instruments and common items like a toothbrush or razor that may have provoked bleeding.
  Besides blood, HBV also lives in other bodily fluids, including saliva. But unlike some viruses, hepatitis B isn’t easily transmitted through saliva. That means you aren’t likely to get it from sharing food or eating utensils or from someone coughing or sneezing on you.

  Most people who have Hepatitis B do not know they have it. The disease does not always cause symptoms. Hepatitis B can stay hidden in the body. Many people can live with Hepatitis B for 20 years without feeling sick. Still, liver damage from the disease can take place during this time.

  Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Chronic hepatitis C can result in serious, even life-threatening health problems like cirrhosis and liver cancer. People with chronic hepatitis C can often have no symptoms and don’t feel sick. When symptoms appear, they often are a sign of advanced liver disease. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.

  Most people with chronic hepatitis C don’t have any symptoms or have only general symptoms like chronic fatigue and depression. Many people eventually develop chronic liver disease, which can range from mild to severe and include cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. Chronic liver disease in people with hepatitis C usually happens slowly, without any signs or symptoms, over several decades. Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is often not recognized until people are screened for blood donation or from an abnormal blood test found during a routine doctor’s visit.
